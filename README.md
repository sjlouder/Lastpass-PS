[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/sacrificialarts/sacrificialarts/_apis/build/status/sjlouder.Lastpass-PS?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/sacrificialarts/sacrificialarts/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

DESCRIPTION
=======
Powershell module to interact with Lastpass.
 
Built on pure Powershell/.NET core, designed to work without any other external dependencies to maximize cross platform portability.

Based on [lastpass-cli](https://github.com/lastpass/lastpass-cli) and [lastpass-sharp](https://github.com/detunized/lastpass-sharp).

EXAMPLE
---
```
# Prompts for credentials
Connect-Lastpass

# You can also include the app MFA code
$Credential = Get-Credential
Connect-Lastpass -Credential $Credential -OneTimePassword '038502'

# Get specific account by name
$GmailAccount = Get-Account 'Gmail'

# Get PSCredential that can be used in other Powershell commands
$GmailAccount.Credential

# Or, get username and password directly
$GmailAccount.Username
$GmailAccount.Password
```
